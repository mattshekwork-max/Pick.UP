# Pick-UP — Design Specification

This document is the **design authority** for Voxadora. Every visual decision during the build MUST follow this spec. Do not deviate from these choices — they were selected specifically for this product's domain, audience, and brand personality.

## Brand Identity

**Personality:** warm
**Product:** AI voice receptionist for every small business

This is not a generic SaaS template. Voxadora should look like a product with its own design team — something you'd see on Product Hunt with 500+ upvotes, not something that obviously came from a generator.

## Color System

All colors use oklch() format in Tailwind CSS v4. Convert these hex values to oklch() when writing CSS variables.

| Role | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | #0D9488 | Brand color. Primary buttons, active nav states, key UI accents, links. |
| **Secondary** | #f0fdfa | Supporting elements. Secondary buttons, section backgrounds, subtle borders. |
| **Accent** | #F97316 | Highlight sparingly. Success states, badges, notification dots, hover effects. |
| **Background** | #faf9f7 | Page background. NOT pure white. This subtle tint creates warmth/coolness. |

**Color rules:**
- Primary color appears on every screen but is never overwhelming — it should guide the eye, not assault it
- Secondary color does the heavy lifting for borders, dividers, muted text, inactive states
- Accent is the "pop" — use it for max 2-3 elements per screen
- Derive hover/active/disabled states from the primary: hover = slightly darker, active = darker still, disabled = 40% opacity
- Dark mode (if applicable): invert the value scale, keep the hue. Don't just slap `dark:` classes — redesign the palette for dark backgrounds.

## Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Tracking |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Headings** | Sora | 600-700 | tight (-0.02em) |
| **Body** | Plus Jakarta Sans | 400-500 | normal |
| **Mono/Data** | System mono stack | 400 | normal |

**Typography rules:**
- Import BOTH fonts via `@import` at the VERY TOP of `globals.css`, BEFORE all other CSS
- Heading font is for h1-h3 ONLY. Do not use it for buttons, labels, or body text.
- Body font handles everything else: paragraphs, buttons, nav, labels, form inputs
- Use `max-w-prose` or `max-w-2xl` for body text blocks — never let text run full-width
- Font size hierarchy: h1=2.25rem, h2=1.5rem, h3=1.25rem, body=0.875-1rem. Be consistent.

## Component Design Language

### Border Radius: rounded (12px)

Warm, friendly, inviting. Buttons feel touchable. Cards feel like physical objects you want to pick up. Everything feels soft and approachable.

**Apply consistently:** buttons, cards, inputs, dropdowns, modals, badges, tooltips, images — everything shares the same radius system. The ONLY exception is avatars (always fully rounded) and very small badges/pills (can be fully rounded regardless of system).

### Component Personality

**Warm personality** — friendly, approachable, feels like a helpful friend.
- **Buttons:** Rounded, inviting fills. Primary buttons should feel "clickable" — consider subtle shadows or gradients. Icon+text buttons encouraged.
- **Cards:** Rounded corners, soft shadows. Cards should feel like friendly containers. Consider colored left borders or top accent bars for variety.
- **Navigation:** Friendly top nav with avatar. Active states use the primary color warmly. Consider emoji or icons next to nav labels.
- **Data display:** Card-based over tables. Visual progress indicators (bars, rings). Friendly data viz with rounded chart elements.
- **Interactions:** Medium speed (200ms). Hover states should feel inviting (slight lift, warm color shift). Consider micro-animations.
- **Empty states:** Illustrated, encouraging, with personality. "No projects yet — let's create your first one!" with a friendly illustration.
- **Modals vs drawers:** Modals for celebrations and important moments. Drawers for editing. Inline expansion for small actions.
- **shadcn components to favor:** Card, Avatar, Progress, Badge, HoverCard, Popover, Alert (for friendly notices), Carousel.

### Layout Architecture

**Hero layout:** split
- Left side: headline, subheadline, CTA. Right side: product illustration/screenshot/visual.
- The visual side should be at least 45% of the width. Don't cram it.

**Feature layout:** bento
- Mixed-size grid: 1-2 large hero cards + smaller supporting cards.
- Large cards get more visual treatment (illustration, screenshot, demo).
- This is NOT a uniform 3-column grid — vary the sizes intentionally.

**Dashboard layout:**
- Use a sidebar navigation for 4+ sections, top tabs for 2-3 sections
- Main content area: max-w-6xl with consistent horizontal padding
- Cards for distinct data groups, tables for list data
- Every screen needs a clear primary action (top-right button or inline CTA)

### Spacing & Density

- Page padding: 24-32px horizontal, 32-48px vertical sections
- Card padding: 16-24px internal
- Between cards: 16-24px gap
- Between sections: 48-64px
- Use Tailwind's spacing scale consistently: 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
- When in doubt: add more space, not less

### Shadows & Elevation

- Cards: `shadow-sm` default, `shadow-md` on hover (if interactive)
- Modals/drawers: `shadow-xl`
- Buttons: no shadow (unless the brand personality calls for it)
- Dropdowns/popovers: `shadow-lg`
- Never use `shadow-2xl` — it looks like a 2015 Material Design demo

### Icons

- Use Lucide icons exclusively (already in the boilerplate via `lucide-react`)
- Icon size: 16px in buttons/nav, 20px in cards/features, 24px in hero elements
- Icon color: match the text color they sit next to, or use the primary color for emphasis
- Stroke width: use default (2px). Don't mix stroke widths.

## What Makes This Product Unique

The goal is NOT to be "the prettiest template." The goal is to be **recognizable**. If someone screenshots Voxadora and posts it, people should not be able to confuse it with any other product.

Uniqueness comes from the **combination** of:
1. The specific color palette (not just "it's blue")
2. The typography pairing (the heading font carries personality)
3. The radius philosophy (sharp products feel different from rounded ones)
4. The component treatment (how cards, buttons, nav FEEL)
5. The spacing and density (airy vs. compact)
6. The layout choices (sidebar vs. top nav, modals vs. drawers, bento vs. grid)

A finance dashboard with serif headings, sharp corners, and dense tables feels COMPLETELY different from a wellness app with rounded sans-serif, pill buttons, and spacious card layouts — even if both are "good design."

Commit to this spec. Don't water it down by falling back to shadcn defaults.

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

- Do NOT leave shadcn components unstyled/default — every component should reflect the brand
- Do NOT use `bg-blue-600` or any hardcoded Tailwind colors — use your CSS variables
- Do NOT mix border radius values — pick the system radius and apply it everywhere
- Do NOT use more than 2 font families (heading + body, that's it)
- Do NOT center everything — left-aligned content is usually more readable for dashboards
- Do NOT use generic purple-to-blue gradients
- Do NOT use default gray-100 backgrounds for cards — use your secondary color at low opacity
- Do NOT use spinners for loading — use Skeleton components
- Do NOT leave empty states blank — every empty state needs a message and a primary action
